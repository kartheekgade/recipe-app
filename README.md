Frontend: React.js

I developed a simple web application called Cookbook, which allows users to explore various recipes across different categories. The front-end of this application is built using React.js. The application is organized into reusable components to maintain modularity and scalability:
CategoryList: Displays a list of recipe categories on the left sidebar.
RecipeList: Dynamically fetches and displays recipes based on the selected category.
RecipeDetails: Shows detailed information about the selected recipe in a modal window.
Welcome Message: A stylish "Welcome to Cookbook" message is displayed in the content area when no category is selected, creating a friendly first impression.

Key Features:
Dynamic Rendering: Recipes are dynamically rendered based on the selected category.
Modular Components: The app is divided into functional components, allowing easy maintenance and future scalability.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across various devices.

Technologies Used:
React.js for front-end development.
CSS for styling.
